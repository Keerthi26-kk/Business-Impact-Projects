1️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction – Retaining Valuable Customers

Project Overview
Customer retention is crucial for businesses, as losing customers leads to revenue loss and higher acquisition costs. This project leverages Machine Learning to predict customer churn and help businesses take proactive retention measures.

Objective
To build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning based on behavioral patterns, transaction history, and engagement levels.

Dataset & Features
Historical customer data (purchase history, service usage, complaints)
Demographics (age, location, tenure)
Engagement metrics (frequency of interactions, support tickets)
Methodology
✔ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical data.
✔ Model Training: Implemented Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to classify churn likelihood.
✔ Evaluation: Used ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrix to measure performance.

Key Findings & Business Impact
✔ Identified high-risk customers before they churn
✔ Provided insights for personalized marketing strategies
✔ Enabled targeted retention campaigns to reduce customer loss

Technologies Used
📌 Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
📌 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
📌 Feature Engineering & Model Tuning

2️⃣ Dynamic Pricing – Optimizing Revenue Strategies

Project Overview
Dynamic pricing is a strategy where prices adjust based on demand, competition, and market conditions. This project builds a Machine Learning model that recommends optimal prices for maximizing revenue.

Objective
To develop an intelligent pricing model that predicts the best price point for products/services based on market trends, demand fluctuations, and competitor pricing.

Dataset & Features
Historical sales data (product prices, demand, revenue)
External factors (seasonality, competitor pricing, promotions)
Customer behavior (purchase frequency, willingness to pay)
Methodology
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified pricing patterns and demand fluctuations.
✔ Model Training: Used Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to predict optimal prices.
✔ Evaluation: Measured model accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Key Findings & Business Impact
✔ Maximized revenue by identifying price points that drive sales
✔ Optimized pricing strategies based on demand forecasting
✔ Improved profitability while maintaining competitive pricing

Technologies Used
📌 Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM
📌 Data Visualization (Seaborn, Plotly)
📌 Time Series Analysis & Demand Forecasting
